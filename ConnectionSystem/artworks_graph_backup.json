            "description": "description: In Blue, Jenjira Pongpas (star of Apichatpong Weerasethakul\u2019s Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives and Cemetery of Splendor) lay on a bed in the middle of a forest clearing. A spark flickers, floating in the center of her chest and slowly grows over time into a crackling, consuming conflagration. This fire is an illusion\u2014superimposed footage that extends through the image\u2014and yet its emotional effects are palpable as the camera fixates on the sleepless Jenjira into the night. Is it a flame of love that has caught her heart? Is it a pleasurable yearning or hungered irritation? Does blue name a state of mind\u2014a melancholy that weighs on the insomniac? Scrolled likay folk theatre screens unroll in the background, suggestive of alternate realities, picturesque landscapes heated by a blood-red sun. Hot and cool, passion and placidity, these polarities exist super-imposed, as in a feverish dream. Blue captures something of the primal magic of Apichatpong\u2019s cinema, evoking complex feelings from the most mundane of elements.   Artist Bio:  Apichatpong Weerasethakul (b. 1970, Bangkok) creates installations, videos, short and feature films that are often non-linear and transmit a strong sense of dislocation and otherworldliness. Frequently set in rural Thai villages and forests, his films traverse an extremely personal territory and invite viewers to enter the subjective world of memory, myth, and deep yearning. Over the years he has worked with the same actors, which allowed him to capture different phases of their lives and their experience of ageing. He earned a B.Arch. from Khon Kaen University in 1994 and a MFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1997. Apichatpong has been active in promoting experimental and independent films through Kick the Machine, a company he founded in 1999.

Complementing other proposed works by the artist, this set of acquisitions will make the National Collection into an important repository of the oeuvre of Apichatpong Weerasethakul, one of the most widely celebrated Southeast Asian artists globally. style significance: Filmmaker-artist of Thai origin Apichatpong Weerasethakul is known for crossing the boundaries between cinema and installation art, documentary film and fiction, and the work of memory, myth and fantasy. Born in Bangkok and raised in the city of Khon Khaen in northeast Thailand, Apichatpong often weaves his personal memories of this rural area with the country\u2019s political histories in his film and video art. Drawing heavily from local supernatural beliefs, folk performances, and vernacular Buddhism, Apichatpong\u2019s films offer poetic and radically defamiliarized accounts of Thailand\u2019s historical trauma, ethnic minoritization, and sexual desire. Heterogeneous temporalities challenge and disrupt the configuration of a more continuous cultural and political memory, as well as the viewer\u2019s individual perception. Apichatpong\u2019s films challenge cinematic generic convention, blurring boundaries between documentary and fiction, realism and fantasy, high art and low art. His preoccupation with slow-paced, non-linear narrative, visual stasis, and sonic ambience has also been praised by critics for its potential to create an immersive sensorial experience for viewers.  Blue is a short film-cum-video installation work that distils, in its simplicity, the quiet allure of Apichatpong\u2019s cinematic worlds. Little happens in this video, safe for the small motions of the listless actress Jenjira Pongpas, as she struggles to fall asleep. And yet, Apichatpong is able to evoke a multi-layered narrative from this simple sequence, as he superimposes footage of a fire that over time progresses to consume Jenjira. Attention is directed to the actress\u2019 facial gestures, a weariness that seems gain emotional gravity when set against the sounds of an smouldering, growing flame.   Through the work\u2019s subdued emotive power, Apichatpong also opens up the question of its relationship to vernacular entertainment in Southeast Asia, in this case, the folk theatre form known as likay. The backdrop to Blue is a typical likay scrolling screen, often depicting fantastical architecture and mythological landscapes in bright techni-color. If likay revels in melodrama, ornamental excess, and caricatured personalities, Blue suggests that such a theatre of surfaces and illusions may also hold space for quieter emotive power.

            "description": "description: Born in Manila in 1940, Brenda Villanueva Fajardo first studied painting at the Philippine Women\u2019s University before completing a Master of Science in Art Education at the University of Wisconsin, United States. With a great interest in histoy, both social and political, of the Philippines, she later competed a Doctor of Philosophy in Philippines Studies from the University of Philippines in 1997. Fajardo\u2019s works bridge the gap between academic training and visual folk culture by using the techniques of the graphic artist while introducing a hint of chance into her work through freehand drawing. She creates surprises in her works by choosing unconventional surfaces like grass paper, and also by appropriating the popular visual logic of illustrated storytelling, with its carnival-like imagery and vibrant colours. This can be seen through her paintings in late-1980s, using tarot cards as a source of inspiration to illustrate the developments of Philippine history. Brenda Villanueva Fajardo was awarded the Thirteen Artists award by the Cultural Centre of Philippines in 1992 and later the Centennial Award for the Arts in 1999.   With the criticality of post-colonial perspectives and a love of classic storytelling, Brenda Fajardo adopts the persona of Babylan, the native priestess, and reassesses Philippine history through the framing device of the medieval tarot card. Dramatising the narratives of ancient and recent past, Fajardo is the artist-seer who deals out history in four \u201cfolds\u201d, akin to a tarot card spread. With a prologue and epilogue, the folds tell of the early life of the archipelago, the period of Spanish domination, the period of American rule and the Japanese Occupation, and post-independence. The central image in each work illustrates a particular episode, and is held in dynamic configuration with the surrounding major and minor arcane cards.   Historical episodes, political events, social upheavals, personal identities and the fate of individuals are electrified with the tarot\u2019s potent symbolism and iconography, such as the Tower of Destruction, the World, the Wheel of Fortune. But the European medieval tarot has also been indigenized and the imagery is redrawn using the native folk aesthetic. The tarot foretells the future but the high priestess has also pulled a card trick: the cards of fate and fortune are used retrospectively, and thus signal a desire to recast the fate of the past and suggest the possibility of alternative realities or futures.  historical significance: Nil style significance: The 13 pieces of drawings, of equal dimensions, relate an interpretation of Philippine history from its pre-hispanic period to the fall of Marcos regime in 1986. Prologue and epilogue pieces are included in this series. Each drawing is schematised using the following devices: A series of tarot cards immaculately drawn and arranged upright around a larger central and rectangular illustration. The tarot cards, while maintaining pictorial conventions derived from European traditions, have adapted indigenous motifs and folklore. Borders between the cards and central illustrations are painted with gold colour. Where deemed necessary by the artist, the central illustration are accompanied by texts written in Filipino. The narrative may be divided into four parts as proposed by the titles: pre-Spanish, the Spanish the American, the Philippine and the post-Marcos period. The artist made explicit the interest and aims of her Tarot Card series; the tarot card series focuses on social realities juxtaposed with images from the tarot of the medieval times. This usually comes as series of images from history, from social-political conditions of society or from current events. The European tarot divination cards have been interpreted and adapted by using images of the Filipino. Contary to popular belief that the tarot cards are evil, the artirst have realised that the symbology carried in the cards are inded potent spiritually but not malevolent at all. Redrawn to suit Philippine life and situation, it has accquired a folk or native quality in its rendering. The inclusion of gold in the works represent the spirit-world while subdued tones indicate life in the material world. exhibition utilisation: Nil",

Stemming from how this memorable visit was during the monsoon season, the choppy conditions of the sea left a deep impression on Dusadee. Furthermore, since the primary purpose of the visit to Phuket was for surfing, Dusadee had watched his brother conquer these towering waves with both trepidation and pride \u2013 the flaccid penis affixed to the sculpture sheds light on the fear that the artist experienced as he watched his brother.   The wave motif present in his numerous works, should perhaps be best understood through Jungian Archetypes \u2013 universal archaic themes from the depths of humanity\u2019s collective unconsciousness \u2013 and in these cases, the deluge myth in particular. As put forth by David Leeming in The Oxford Companion to World Mythology, deluge myths often feature the presence of a human flood hero, representative of \u201cthe human craving for life\u201d. In this regard, the hero in Dusadee\u2019s personal flood mythos would be his brother, \u201cthe champ\u201d, who stands in as the symbol for the other individuals who were present in those monsoon waves at that time as well.   It is at this juncture that the work departs from personal narrative alone to offer critique on some universal issues \u2013 and in this instance, the labour market. The monsoon season in Phuket is also the off-peak tourist season, the large dangerous waves multiply the dangers of surfing and the generally dreary weather deters sunbathers from the beach. It is therefore at this time that when tourists and vacationers are away, that the individuals helming the tourism industry find some respite and take their own holidays \u2013 and simultaneously become subjects to the unwelcome waves for surfing.   What then does holiday season mean? To whom are the holidays designated towards? These are questions that warrant further contemplation.    In conjunction with the other pieces to be collected as a package from the artist, this work offers viewers an intimate look at the personal life of the artist as explored through the artwork \u2013 the different pieces highlighting different facets of the artist\u2019s personal struggles in coming to terms. In Dusadee\u2019s examination of his own personal relationships and memories, viewers find themselves connected to his works through the universal emotions of fear and loss.  style significance: He was out there all alone riding the monsoon waves like a champ harkens back to a time when the artist\u2019s brother was still alive \u2013 during a holiday to Phuket.

Furthermore, since the primary purpose of the visit to Phuket was for surfing, Dusadee had watched his brother conquer these towering waves with both trepidation and pride \u2013 the flaccid penis affixed to the sculpture sheds light on the fear that the artist experienced as he watched his brother.   The wave motif present in his numerous works, should perhaps be best understood through Jungian Archetypes \u2013 universal archaic themes from the depths of humanity\u2019s collective unconsciousness \u2013 and in these cases, the deluge myth in particular. As put forth by David Leeming in The Oxford Companion to World Mythology, deluge myths often feature the presence of a human flood hero, representative of \u201cthe human craving for life\u201d. In this regard, the hero in Dusadee\u2019s personal flood mythos would be his brother, \u201cthe champ\u201d, who stands in as the symbol for the other individuals who were present in those monsoon waves at that time as well.   It is at this juncture that the work departs from personal narrative alone to offer critique on some universal issues \u2013 and in this instance, the labour market. The monsoon season in Phuket is also the off-peak tourist season, the large dangerous waves multiply the dangers of surfing and the generally dreary weather deters sunbathers from the beach. It is therefore at this time that when tourists and vacationers are away, that the individuals helming the tourism industry find some respite and take their own holidays \u2013 and simultaneously become subjects to the unwelcome waves for surfing.   What then does holiday season mean? To whom are the holidays designated towards? These are questions that warrant further contemplation.    In conjunction with the other pieces to be collected as a package from the artist, this work offers viewers an intimate look at the personal life of the artist as explored through the artwork \u2013 the different pieces highlighting different facets of the artist\u2019s personal struggles in coming to terms. In Dusadee\u2019s examination of his own personal relationships and memories, viewers find themselves connected to his works through the universal emotions of fear and loss.  exhibition utilisation: The primary use of the artwork is for exhibition purposes, and will be especially relevant to shows focusing on a survey of Thai contemporary art forms. The unique practice of Dusadee Huntrakul also adds diversity to the range of themes that can be explored in such exhibitions, providing a more holistic understanding of the Thai contemporary art scene to exhibition visitors.

The porcelain rope seemingly defiant to the attraction of gravity lends the work a certain \u00e9lan vital, and the work exudes an energy seemingly further amplified by two small egg-shaped pieces that rest upon the sculpture.

The wave motif present in other works from Dusadee also makes an appearance here. Now, in conjunction with the spheres, the waves seem to suggest the primordial nature of water, and it as a life force in itself.   While the organic curvatures lend the work a quiet sensuality, the work also incorporates other peculiarities unique to Dusadee\u2019s sculptural practice: a piece of faeces left behind by a common household gecko made by the artist, and an anthropomorphic pebble. These various elements serve as symbolic markers of the artist\u2019s concerns and provide viewers with an entry point to understanding issues that range from his own personal history, to the means of art production and the value of art in the economic ecosystem, but also at times, adding a flair of humour to the work. As is characteristic to his practice, these objects from personal stories often find themselves extrapolated into a commentary on larger issues.   Sharing his studio space with numerous geckos, Dusadee would sometimes find his works with real gecko excrement on it. Originally including his own hand-crafted gecko faeces as a mischievious taunt to his studio\u2019s co-inhabitants, these little nuggets eventually took a more serious turn as a means of questioning the value of an artwork beyond the economic context, and even beyond art, the intrinsic value of shit itself. Dusadee\u2019s scatological of inquiries on value extends even prior to being acquainted with his studio\u2019s geckos \u2013 commencing in his varsity days when one his lecturer commented that his work \u201clooked like shit\u201d. The inclusion of scatological elements to various works since then pay homage to this moment of enlightenment.   A crudely \u201chand-made\u201d pebble with a face drawn onto it anthropomorphizes not just the pebble itself, but the work in entirety \u2013 the sculpture itself begs to be re-thought \u2013 perhaps it is a abstract of a reclining figure? Yet given that this anthropomorphic pebble has no fixed placement as well, its numerous possible placements suggest different interpretations of the work as a whole, making apparent the fluidity of the work\u2019s form.   Residing within a seemingly absurd work, Dusadee rewards viewers with an internal logic, which unfolds slowly upon contemplation.  style significance: Untitled incorporates numerous elements characteristic of Dusadee Huntrakul\u2019s ceramic practice.

The unique practice of Dusadee Huntrakul also adds diversity to the range of themes that can be explored in such exhibitions, providing a more holistic understanding of the Thai contemporary art scene to exhibition visitors.

            "description": "description: The practice of Burmese artist Htein Lin spans the gamut from painting to installation to performance. He spent almost seven years in jail (1998\u20132004) for political reasons; during this time he developed his artistic practice by using bowls and cigarette lighters, in the absence of brushes, to make paintings and monoprints on prison uniforms. After his release, he moved to London in 2006, but returned to Myanmar in 2013. Soap Blocked was one of two Burmese projects included in the 2016 Singapore Biennale (\u201cAn Atlas of Mirrors\u201d). It comprises a map of Myanmar, painstakingly constructed of a thousand squares of sculpted Shwe Wah soap, and stands as testament to the vicissitudes of Htein Lin\u2019s tumultuous life. Having participated in the failed uprising of 1988 \u2013 an event commemorated today as a milestone in the country\u2019s march towards the establishment of a democratic polity \u2013 he was forced to flee underground, spending several years in refugee camps on the border. He escaped and returned to Yangon in the early 1990s, but was again arrested and jailed on charges of opposition activity; he subsequently spent almost seven years behind bars and was released only in 2004. During this time he turned to art. In the absence of proper art-making tools, he used what meagre materials were made available to him to produce works on scraps of fabric, on prison uniforms \u2013 and in soap. One of the works that emerged from this period was a little carving of a captive human figure, hunched over and trapped within the claustrophobic confines of four walls, sculpted from a bar of Shwe Wah soap. The carving was smuggled out by a Red Cross representative after a prison visit in 1999, as a means of conveying to the rest of the world the deplorable state of the country\u2019s prisons. Soap Blocked returns to the original moment of the artist\u2019s desperate, clandestine plea. The installation maps and reflects the experience of thousands of political prisoners in Myanmar in recent decades, including the artist\u2019s own incarceration. The work amplifies autobiographical resonance into a starkly visceral monument to the collective helplessness that the people of the country often faced during the years of socialist military rule. historical significance: Burmese artist Htein Lin was born in 1966, in Ingapu, Myanmar.

Htein Lin recalls of his time in prison: \u201cCramped in a cell for 22 hours a day, I carved a soap block to express our physical conditions \u2026 The socialist government of Burma used to say that prison is a place to cleanse sins. We only had one government-produced soap in those days to do that. It was called Shwe Wah or Golden Yellow, just as our country is known as the Golden Land. In prison, we received one piece every two weeks. No longer available on the open market, but only in prisons and government co-operative stores, the smell of Shwe Wah recalls the dark ages of the one-party socialist system. Soon the soap will vanish completely, just as the Burmese way to socialism was washed away by market forces and modernisation.\u201d  Soap Blocked is a memento mori to a fast vanishing way of life, albeit one that passes unmourned. Displayed in the shape of a map of Myanmar, the work amplifies autobiographical resonance into a starkly visceral monument to the collective helplessness that the people of the country often faced during the years of socialist military rule. style significance: Burmese artist Htein Lin was born in 1966, in Ingapu, Myanmar.

Conceptualised for the Hair for Hope exhibition in support of cancer victims and survivors, the strands of hair which constitute the hand woven flowers in The Flower Bed originate from cancer victims, chemotherapy patients, cancer survivors, and donors to the program. The thousands of hand-woven flowers representative of Elysium, consoling cancer victims and relations of the pain they are currently undergoing, while reminding them of a better place that is to come. Marveling at the degree of detail in each piece, a viewer is also reminded of the necessary perseverance to overcome times of challenge. With this particular work, Imhathai Suwatthanasilp reaffirms her position as one of the top contemporary artists pushing the boundaries of the textile medium.  historical significance: The artistic practice of Imhathai is closely intertwined with her personal history. Following the death of her father from cancer, the use of human hair weaving has become an integral part of her artworks, which focus on her relationships with her family and the transient nature of life. The Flower Bed is an installation that deals with the pains of dying from cancer \u2013 however, unlike her earlier works, such as My Father\u2019s Pillow that focused largely on her personal relationships and loss, this new work extends an empathetic hand to other individuals facing such an end.   As contemporary artists continue to explore a wider array of materials for the making of artworks, Imhathai is a forerunner in the use of human hair in the making of works. Each strand of human hair is representative of the fragility of life \u2013 and like how one may not ascertain if each strand of hair is alive of dead, incorporates an element of mystery to the works she creates. Looking at the works, one may be led to consider the origins of each strand of hair \u2013 do they belong to a man, or woman? What about the personal stories of the individual from which each strand of hair originates from?   Conceptualised for the Hair for Hope exhibition in support of cancer victims and survivors, the strands of hair which constitute the hand woven flowers in The Flower Bed originate from cancer victims, chemotherapy patients, cancer survivors, and donors to the program.  Thereby making this light box installation within a mattress and bed frame a consolidation of the multitudes of stories that can be distilled down to one of loss and reparation. The bed, as an object symbolic of the place of suffering and death is transformed by Imhathai\u2019s inclusion of hair weavings and light box into an object offering consolation to individuals facing such hardship. The thousands of hand-woven flowers representative of Elysium, consoling cancer victims and relations of the pain they are currently undergoing, while reminding them of a better place that is to come. In this regard, the site of suffering simultaneously becomes the portal to a happier end.   With the strands of hair woven and crocheted into intricate lace pieces, the fragility of each object is further intensified. Marveling at the degree of detail in each piece, a viewer is also reminded of the necessary perseverance to overcome times of challenge.

As contemporary artists continue to explore a wider array of materials for the making of artworks, Imhathai is a forerunner in the use of human hair in the making of works. Each strand of human hair is representative of the fragility of life \u2013 and like how one may not ascertain if each strand of hair is alive of dead, incorporates an element of mystery to the works she creates. Looking at the works, one may be led to consider the origins of each strand of hair \u2013 do they belong to a man, or woman? What about the personal stories of the individual from which each strand of hair originates from?   Conceptualised for the Hair for Hope exhibition in support of cancer victims and survivors, the strands of hair which constitute the hand woven flowers in The Flower Bed originate from cancer victims, chemotherapy patients, cancer survivors, and donors to the program.  Thereby making this light box installation within a mattress and bed frame a consolidation of the multitudes of stories that can be distilled down to one of loss and reparation. The bed, as an object symbolic of the place of suffering and death is transformed by Imhathai\u2019s inclusion of hair weavings and light box into an object offering consolation to individuals facing such hardship. The thousands of hand-woven flowers representative of Elysium, consoling cancer victims and relations of the pain they are currently undergoing, while reminding them of a better place that is to come. In this regard, the site of suffering simultaneously becomes the portal to a happier end.   With the strands of hair woven and crocheted into intricate lace pieces, the fragility of each object is further intensified. Marveling at the degree of detail in each piece, a viewer is also reminded of the necessary perseverance to overcome times of challenge. With this particular work, Imhathai Suwatthanasilp reaffirms her position as one of the top contemporary artists pushing the boundaries of the textile medium.  exhibition utilisation: The primary use of the artwork is for exhibition purposes, and will be especially relevant to shows focusing on a survey of Thai contemporary art forms, exploring the range of materials employed by artists, or thematic shows.

Featuring a suite of ambiguous, androgynous figures whose gender identity has been deliberately erased \u2013 lacking obvious gender signifiers such as genitalia and hair \u2013 they are, in the artist\u2019s words, \u201clanguid, open, revealing but still maintaining an air of dignity and mystery.\u201d These figures are painted on seas of blood red, a reference of course to that essential bodily fluid, and also, more importantly, on the back of carton packages that antiretroviral drugs come in. After moving back to his hometown of Kota Kinabalu in 2017, the artist managed to befriend an HIV/AIDS outreach officer at the local hospital who managed to help him source the additional packaging that was needed. The titles of the individual paintings \u2013 \u201cGanymede\u201d, \u201cAtlas\u201d, \u201cIcarus\u201d and \u201cApollo\u201d \u2013 reference Greek mythology as representing archetypal characters. Ganymede, desired for his youthful beauty, is abducted by Zeus in the guise of an eagle to Mount Olympus, so that he could be made an immortal cupbearer to the Gods, in addition to becoming an object of Zeus\u2019s lust. Atlas, as punishment for having chosen the losing side of history in the war between the Titans and Olympians, is burdened with carrying the heavens on his back for eternity. Icarus, the son of the inventor Daedalus, who fell into the sea after daring to fly too close to the sun with his artificial wings in defiance of his father\u2019s advice. Apollo, the powerful and handsome god of the sun, whose charisma and brilliance barely hid an egoistic, jealous and sometimes vengeful personality. The fates of these characters and what they symbolize resonated with Kugan\u2019s sense of the tragedy and irony of his own predicament.  historical significance: The National Collection \u2013 or, at least, those parts of it that come under the purview of SAM \u2013 is at present rather lacking in contemporary Malaysian art, especially works of art by artists whose works deal openly with their own minority identities \u2013 and, in this case, HIV. This piece by Kugan speaks not only to particular realities of contemporary queer life, but also a facet of life today (HIV-AIDS) that is not addressed in the Natl. Collection.  style significance: In the artist\u2019s own words:  \u201cIn December 2015, I was asked to resign from my post as manager of a prominent commercial art gallery in Kuala Lumpur three months after starting work, ostensibly due to the fact that my employer discovered I was HIV+, a condition that I myself only found out during the health screening procedure required by when I joined the company. From my experience as a LGBT rights activist, I knew that Malaysian employees are not protected by law from discrimination based on their HIV status, so I figured that legal recourse against a large corporation would end up being a costly and lengthy process, something that I didn\u2019t want to go through. And not wanting to continue working in what I perceived to be an unsupportive work environment, I tended my resignation. What followed in the two years since has been a difficult personal reassessment of my life, coming to terms with real and perceived HIV stigma, finding support in unexpected places, undergoing therapy, and using art as a way to reinvent my identity.  Right after my resignation, I began antiretroviral therapy in January 2016, receiving care from Sungai Buloh Hospital where most newly diagnosed HIV patients based in and around the Klang Vallery area receive their initial treatment. Hospital visits were in the beginning a stressful affair. The nurses seemed inundated by the number of new cases that flooded into the hospital, resulting in long waiting periods \u2013 my first visit lasted six hours in total, most of which was spent on waiting for my number to be called. I soon learned to bring a book with me, to alleviate the anxiety of waiting for needles and medication. While working, I had been able to afford living a comfortable middle class lifestyle. But after resigning, money became a real issue. In hindsight, I should\u2019ve looked for a job. But in the emotional state I was in, I was not prepared to receive another round of workplace discrimination. And perhaps I was wrong to expect assistance and support from my friends, but that was exactly what happened. And when that was not forthcoming, I decided in my audacity to forego my qualifications as a trained writer to become a full-time artist.  Ultimately it was a decision that for better or worse allowed me to retain some measure of self-worth. Self-worth that also mocked the downgrading circumstances of my life \u2013 forced by my dwindling savings to move from a relatively affluent neighbourhood to an apartment sponsored by a friend in a working class area , whose impoverished surroundings only reflected how much I had fallen from grace. The move also isolated me from my social circle. As a person who was proudly out and bourgeois, I experienced what was essential a riches-to-rags, hitting rock bottom reality check scenario, fueled by increasing bouts of depression, frustration and disappointment. It wasn\u2019t a situation I thought that I would ever experience as I entered my 40s. Nevertheless, I was adamant about pursuing the one thing that I thought could redeem me: art. Although I have no formal training in art, I\u2019ve been casually pursuing my art practice since 1998, in tandem with my other life as a self-taught musician and poet. Out of the three mediums, however, making art turned out the perfect medium for me to articulate what I was. I couldn\u2019t sing or write about the virus that was inside me, but somehow I could draw it out. And that was what I did. How does one make queer art? It\u2019s a question I\u2019m still trying to figure out. But drawing on my experiences as an co-organizer of queer events including Seksualiti Merdeka (with Pang Khee Teik, Angela Kuga Thas, Lim Chung Wei, Thilaga Sulatireh, et al) and Rainbow Rojak; interactions with other queer-identifying individuals within the community, especially the trans artist Shika and drag queen Shelah (performed by Edwin Sumun); and my own personal experience as a cis gay man who has never identified with the gay community because of my rejection of the mainstreaming/sanitizing/dilution of queer concerns/issues/identities as an act that disempowers and displaces the LGBT community as a whole.  It\u2019s my personal belief, that queer transgression although it should remain open to discourse, must be loyal to what makes it different from the heteronormative. But how to translate these ideas visually in a way that can be accepted in conservative and heteronormative Malaysia, without resorting to verbose queerspeak?  I chose to address erasure/ambiguity of identity: one of the key aspects of my depictions of the human figure was that although they are nude, they lack obvious gender signifiers: no breasts, no genitalia, no body hair. Although this androgynous quality was not always adhered to, I was very aware of how the bodies are perceived. By removing genitalia, I wanted viewers to look at the bodies in a non-gendered, non-erotic way, to see the body as a symbol, or metaphor upon which a post-feminist queer reading could be projected. By removing something, it makes it more obvious that it\u2019s not there. I also drew the figures with eyes closed so that the subject matter don\u2019t appear too confrontational to the viewer\u2019s gaze. I positioned their limbs in rather limpid \u201climp-wristed\u201d articulation, using forms borrowed from Renaissance-era Mannerist art as my reference point, elongating limbs but not to the point of total exaggeration. I wanted the bodies to be languid, open, revealing but still maintaining an air of dignity and mystery. I found that it helped viewers to also view the figures with less prejudice; challenging the nature of their gaze by acquiescing to it. But the series is not a total rejection of the more scatological aspect of the human body. In the end, after experimenting with different colours, I chose to limit my medium to pencil for the human bodies as a play on my personal \u201cdrawing\u201d out of the body. I also limited my colour palette to red and gold pigments, in order to make metaphorical allusions to blood (life) and urine (death), which also helped to unify the works visually. The exhibition, which was staged at Raw Art Space, KL, between December 9 and 15, was titled \u201cRed & Gold\u201d. In some of the works, inspired by the use of non-traditional mediums in the \u201cTalismans\u201d series, I decided to paint some of the human figures, and also a few text-based works, on the back of my HIV medication packaging. I\u2019m still not sure why I did this; perhaps it was an act of reclaiming some of my life back from the virus that has come to define the past two years of my life. These works were the most meaningful to me personally. The \u201cRed & Gold\u201d exhibition also served as my farewell of sorts to the city of KL, where I had lived since 2000. It was a bittersweet end. I wished it wasn\u2019t so. But I had to leave for reasons practical, as well as emotional and psychological. Since I moved back to Kota Kinabalu in December 2017, I\u2019ve been continuing and expanding on the themes and forms that I explored in the \u201cRed & Gold\u201d series of works. This includes making new works that use HIV medication packaging. To make the new \u201cRed\u201d paintings, I managed to befriend an HIV/AIDS outreach officer at the local hospital where my case was transferred who graciously helped me source the additional packaging that I needed.  These new \u201cRed\u201d paintings are slightly larger, and some are painted on packaging for antiretroviral medication that I don\u2019t personally use. I realize that this has changed the intention of the work, which was initially a personal project to come to terms with my HIV status, to become a meditation on broader issues facing the community stricken with the virus. The process resulted in the four paintings - \u201cGanymede\u201d, \u201cAtlas\u201d, \u201cIcarus\u201d and \u201cApollo\u201d. I gave the paintings the titles after I finished them, with the reference to Greek mythology because I saw the figures in the paintings as representing archetypal characters -- somehow the process of continuing with the series has endowed them with narratives, as bombastic as they may seem, that reference the myths.   Ganymede, desired for his youthful beauty, is abducted by Zeus in the guise of an eagle to Mount Olympus, so that he could be made an immortal cupbearer to the Gods, in addition to becoming an object of Zeus\u2019s lust. Atlas, as punishment for having chosen the losing side of history in the war between the Titans and Olympians, is burdened with carrying the heavens on his back for eternity. Icarus, the son of the inventor Daedalus, who fell into the sea after daring to fly too close to the sun with his artificial wings in defiance of his father\u2019s advice. And Apollo, the powerful and handsome god of the sun, whose charisma and brilliance barely hid an egoistic, jealous and sometimes vengeful personality. The fates of these characters and what they symbolise somehow resonated with me because they seemed super tragic, ironic even. Perhaps this is because of my own growing cynicism, but I find it deeply moving as well, because I identify with different aspects of each of their fates and personalities, if only in a fantastic sense. The reference to Greek mythology is also a nod to the Western classical tradition of venerating Hellenistic ideals of the human figure. I\u2019m on the fence on this: while I appreciate the perfect naked sculptures of antiquity, I also think the veneration of them sometimes crosses the line into a pointless ideation of something that is no longer human.   So: the work as I see it is deeply tragicomic. I try to make it as aesthetically pleasing as I can, but materially it is made up of a symbolic artifact of human folly: it is not a cure for there is none. The only way to redemption as I see it is to acknowledge the duality of life: darkness and light, life and death, etc.\u201d  exhibition utilisation: The time is ripe for SAM to mount a survey of contemporary Malaysian art. While shows of contemporary art from other Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam and the Philippines have been organized by our institution in recent years, Malaysia as yet remains very much under the radar screen \u2013 yet this is a country that, up to five decades ago, Singapore was a part of.

            "description": "description: Kawita Vatanajyankur\u2019s immensely popular body of work oftentimes pushes her body\u2019s physical limits, sees her being transformed into ubiquitous objects that feature in our everyday lives. The artist\u2019s choice of objects portray the everyday domestic labour that women have become irrevocably intertwined with in her Thai homeland \u2013 a social reality which struck the artist as somewhat of a culture shock upon her return from studies abroad. As she contorts, suspends, and swings her body to simulate tasks like sweeping, cleaning, washing clothes and hanging them out to dry, the bright cheery colours of the video very quickly make way to reveal a dark comedy that highlights the subtle violence of domestic labor against women.  historical significance: Kawita Vatanajyankur rose to prominence following her graduation from RMIT with a BA Fine Arts, being included in numerous significant presentations in quick succession \u2013 including: Thailand Eye (2017), Islands in the Stream alongside the Venice Biennale (2017), and the Asian Art Biennale Taiwan (2017). Her immensely popular work, that oftentimes pushes her body\u2019s physical limits, have been exceedingly well received by private collectors in Asia, Australia, Europe, and America.   These four works from the TOOLS/WORK series sees Kawita being transformed into ubiquitous objects that feature in our everyday lives \u2013 a dustpan, rag, a linen basket, and finally, linen being hung out to dry. In the series, Kawita\u2019s uncanny choice of objects to portray are telling of the everyday domestic labour that women have become irrevocably intertwined with in her Thai homeland \u2013 a social reality which struck the artist as somewhat of a culture shock upon her return from studies abroad. In this regard, the bright, almost cheerful colours, that the artist has selected for her artworks conceal darker undercurrents; the initial humour upon viewing of the works is rationalized as black rapidly.   The female body transformed into object places the work alongside a historical lineage of feminist contemporary artworks. In the series of artworks, the objectification of the female body further emphasizes the subtle violence that femininity is subject to in the execution of these everyday tasks. In suspending, swinging, and contorting her own body to form these objects she portrays, Kawita\u2019s body becomes a mirror of women pressured into conformity by societal stereotypes.   Furthermore, the nature of the tasks carried out in the work place the idea of domestic labour as ongoing and ceaseless at the centre of the discussion \u2013 the laundry basket will always become full, and the house shall always require dusting. This is compounded by the non-automated nature of these tasks \u2013 especially true in the cultural context of Asia \u2013 where these activities are still regularly performed manually and without the aid of technology. In that regard, even in an age where innovation has allowed for automation of these tasks \u2013 the vacuum cleaner remains purchased for the woman of the house, instead of being purchased for the house itself.  style significance: Kawita Vatanajyankur rose to prominence following her graduation from RMIT with a BA Fine Arts, being included in numerous significant presentations in quick succession \u2013 including: Thailand Eye (2017), Islands in the Stream alongside the Venice Biennale (2017), and the Asian Art Biennale Taiwan (2017).

            "description": "description: Like monochromatic monoliths, Maria Taniguchi\u2019s \u2018Brick\u2019 paintings occupy a silent but palpable presence in space. Each painting in this body of works is covered by a uniform grid of brick lines pencil-drawn onto the surface, and the brick lines perform simultaneously as a formal, visual schema and conceptual device that conjoins each painting to the next \u2013 and all other \u2018Brick\u2019 pieces \u2013 in this decade-long series. An impeccable surface underscores the work\u2019s quality as a two-dimensional painting, yet the work\u2019s objecthood is emphasized by how each \u2018Brick\u2019 is often installed leaning against the wall rather than hanging off it, such that the work oscillates between abstract painting and/or minimalist sculpture. And despite appearing like a wall against a wall, each \u2018Brick\u2019 is, in actuality, an environment or world unto itself: it does not represent anything other than itself. Each stands rather, as a record of time and pain-staking labour for Taniguchi paints each brick individually \u2013 an exercise of repetition that transforms the paintings into temporal registers of artistic process.   Taniguchi is best known for her large-scaled \u2018Bricks\u2019 which make their most impactful statements  \u2013 not merely in terms of physical presence, but more significantly, as visual documents to the passage of time \u2013 and MT_116 stands as one of her rare, few works that approaches such a monumental scale.   Maria Taniguchi (b. 1981, Dumaguete City, Philippines, in 1981) won the Hugo Boss Asia Art Award in 2015 and was a LUX Associate Artist in 2009. Recent exhibitions include History of a vanishing present: A prologue, the Mistake Room, Los Angeles (2016); Afterwork, Para Site, Hong Kong (2016); Globale: New sensorium, ZKM Centre for Art and Media, Karlsruhe, Germany (2016); The vexed contemporary, Museum of Contemporary Art and Design, Manila (2015); and the 8th Asia Pacific Triennial of Contemporary Art, QAGOMA, Brisbane (2015). Her work is held in a number of collections including the M+ Museum, Hong Kong; the Burger Collection, Hong Kong; Kadist Art Foundation, San Francisco; QAGOMA, Brisbane; and the K11 Art Foundation, Shanghai.  historical significance: Like sombre headstones, Maria Taniguchi\u2019s \u2018Brick\u2019 paintings stand as meditative, monolithic entities that occupy a silent but palpable presence in space. The \u2018Bricks\u2019 comprise an on-going series of works that Taniguchi has produced for a decade now, and the paintings may be regarded as individual parts without individualization within a whole body of work, save for variations in size. Each painting surface is covered by a uniform grid of pencil-drawn brick lines that regulates the entirety of the space, where each brick is of the same precise size, measuring 0.5inch x 6 cm. The brick lines thus perform simultaneously as a formal, visual schema and conceptual device that conjoins each painting to the next \u2013 and all other \u2018Brick\u2019 pieces \u2013 and the continuity of this series is underscored by how each work is identified or titled by numerical sequencing based on when it is completed \u2013 in this case, being MT_116.  The relationship between figure and ground is teased and tested here: even as the impeccable surface underscores the work\u2019s quality as a two-dimensional painting, the work\u2019s three-dimensional objecthood is emphasized by how each \u2018Brick\u2019 is often installed leaning against the wall rather than hanging off it, such that the work oscillates between abstract painting and/or minimalist sculpture. Indeed, appearing like a wall against a wall, each work is, in actuality, an environment or world unto itself: it does not reference buildings or the urbanscape, it does not represent anything other than itself. Each stands rather, as a record of time and pain-staking labour for Taniguchi paints each brick individually \u2013 a disciplined, self-reflexive exercise of repetition that transforms the paintings into temporal registers of her artistic process. Moreover, what may initially appear as a monochromatic and monotonous surface reveals itself as a terrain that encompasses subtle variations in the pigment density and minute tonal shifts. From their initial foreboding, static appearance, the paintings convey an unexpected sense of fluidity and movement, evoking an oil slick stilled within the order of a matrix.   In their seriality and repetition, the works call to mind the minimalist works of artists such as Carl Andre or Donald Judd. However, the \u2018Bricks\u2019 also make an important contemporary connection to the vital non-objective and abstract painting tradition within this region that has oft-been relatively overlooked, typified by artists such as Philippines\u2019 Leonardo Aguinaldo or Singapore\u2019s Anthony Poon. Conceptually driven, the \u2018Brick\u2019 works are also a contemporary extension of the conceptual art turn, which has been associated with pioneering practitioners such as Roberto Chabet.  Taniguchi is best known for her large-scaled \u2018Bricks\u2019 which make their most impactful statements  \u2013 not merely in terms of physical presence, but more significantly, as visual documents to the passage of time \u2013 and MT_116 stands as one of her rare, few works that approaches such a monumental scale. MT_116 will be a stark juxtaposition to MT_109 \u2013 which measures a much more diminutive 49.25 x 24.5 cm \u2013 and is also being proposed. Though emerging from the same oeuvre, MT_109 and MT_116 possess vastly different characters and offer a lively and thoughtful dialogue when paired together.

            "description": "description: Melati Suryodarmo (born 12 July 1969 in Surakarta [Solo], Indonesia), is an internationally known female performance artist and is one of the strongest performers of her generation in the country, having also recently been profiled by the New York Times. She is a familiar name in the performance art circuits and has been presenting her work in various international festivals and exhibitions since 1996. Melati works across various disciplines such as performance, video, photography and installation.  She first studied International Relations at the Universitas Padjadjaran in Bandung, Indonesia, in 1993. And then in 1994, she left for Braunschweig, Germany to  study performance art and sculpture at the Hochschule fuer Bildende Kuenste under Profs. Anzu Furukawa (a Japanese Butoh dancer) and Marina Abramovic (a world-renowned Serbian performance artist), where she obtained her BFA in 2001 and later her postgraduate degree in 2002. Melati\u2019s father Suprapto Suryodarmo is a well-known dancer in Indonesia and is an exponent of Amerta, a meditative dance practice which he founded in the 1970s. Her late mother (d. 1987) was also a traditional Javanese dancer.  She currently lives and works in both Surakarta, Indonesia, and Gross Gleidingen, Germany. In the last six years, Melati has been showing her work more frequently in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. And in Solo since 2007, she organises and directs the annual Performance Art Laboratory Project for the Padepokan Lemah Putih  (which her father founded to teach the Amerta movement in Java) and also the performance art event \u201cUndisclosed Territory\u201d. historical significance: Der Sekundentraum or \u201cseconds of the dream\u201d, is an early performance work by  female Indonesian artist Melati Suryodarmo.  The work has been re-performed several times over the years, attesting to its continuing cultural relevance and strong aesthetic impression.   The performance was first enacted at the 24-hour event \u201cFinally\u201d at the Kunstverein Hannover in 1998; and was later re-performed for TV broadcast on the programme \u201cFresh Air\u201d at World House TV, Weimar, in 1999.  She has also performed it at the International Performance Festival Odense, Denmark, in 1999; Performance Abend, Orangerie, Cologne, in 2000; Wuttebergischen Kunstverein Stuttgart in 2004; International Performance Art festival, Schloss Salzau, in 2005, and most recently at the  Indonesian Pavillion at ArtStage Singapore in 2013. It was also after the Singapore performance that the artist lost most of her clothes used for the performance due to postal and courier mishaps, as the Indonesian customs destroyed the clothes after they were unclaimed for three months and mislabelled as used clothing instead of artwork. style significance: Der Sekundentraum was performed for the first time in 1998 in Hannover Germany. This work was inspired by the cultural confrontation that the artist had to deal with as a foreigner and recent migrant to Germany. It represents her own  frantic efforts at finding an identity and fitting in. Hundreds of clothes which she had personally bought and collected from flea markets in Germany (which were sold by the kilo) during her first years of migration reflect the ambiguity, doubts, displacements and replacements of cultural memory and affect.  In the performance, she folded and piled the clothes, messed them up again and put on one by one until she could not move anymore. To Melati, she was dealing with a system which has included her into a kind of preset behaviour. But since moving to another country, she had to give them up and start again from the beginning.

In his work, everyday objects are often suffused with a sense of allegory or poetry.   Time: Dust is a series of works formed by the passage of time and the coming-together of dust and humidity. The gritty reality of urban environments is transformed by the artist into quiet, sublime images.

Commissioned for the Singapore Biennale 2019. exhibition utilisation: This is a versatile and open-ended work with broad appeal. It may be presented in a survey show of art from Myanmar. It could also be included in thematic exhibitions related to explorations of the city / urbanity, or approaches to art-making such as Minimalism.",

            "description": "description: Minstrel Kuik is a Sino-Malaysian artist born in Pantai Remis, Perak, in 1976. She received her tertiary education in Taiwan and France. While trained primarily in painting and philosophy, her practice today is centered on the mediums of photography and drawing, with elements of installation also present. The experience of growing up a Chinese woman in a social polity that privileges male, Malay-Muslim identity is foregrounded in Kuik\u2019s work, where photography, for one, serves as the medium for her to explore social distances and attachments for its documentary and narrative quality. Domesticated Politics emerged from her current series of works that are constituted by the material remnants of the Malaysian 13th General Election that occurred in May 2013. In Kuik\u2019s hands, the paraphernalia, banners and flags from the various parties, advertisements and much more examine the meaning of a today\u2019s national state in contrast to something which should be very familiar to everybody called globalization. In these works, Kuik explores the dynamics between the personal and the political, and how such relations influence a person\u2019s worldview. Her personal identity as Sino- Malaysian, female artist has led her to experiment \u2013 in Domesticated Politics \u2013 with the concept of domestication: to feminize, to soften the once exuberant, masculine and heroic objects, to make these flags immobile and impotent.\u201d  She is seen folding, ironing, and assembling the triangle flags on the floor. By following the proportion of the national flag of Malaysia, these DIY flags are made smaller in the form of pillowcases. At the front of the flags, the movement of the working hands serves as a motif running through the sequence of nine images recomposed according to their visual rhythm. At the back of each flag is a fabric of a colorful pattern, used to suggest the people who are wearing it \u2013 the anonymous voters like herself, gives the front image \u2013 the necessary solidarity. historical significance: Minstrel Kuik is a Sino-Malaysian artist born in Pantai Remis, Perak, in 1976.

The experience of growing up a Chinese woman in a social polity that privileges male, Malay-Muslim identity is foregrounded in Kuik\u2019s work, where photography, for one, serves as the medium for her to explore social distances and attachments for its documentary and narrative quality. Apart from her native Malaysia, she has exhibited in Indonesia, Korea, Japan (she was the winner of the International Photographer Award, Higashikawa International Photo Festival), Ireland, France (Photoquai 2011) and the United States (Houston FotoFest International Discoveries 2009). Kuik was the winner of UOB Painting of the Year (Malaysia) competition in 2014. The current work emerged from a solo presentation by Kuik, After-image: Living with the Ghosts in my House, in 2015. They vary in technique, material and style, with one important link between the digital laser prints, charcoal drawings, and mixed-media installations (which include folded banners, fabrics, paper works and light settings): they are all collected, deconstructed and newly formed remnants of the Malaysian 13th General Election that occurred in May 2013. In Kuik\u2019s hands, the paraphernalia, banners and flags from the various parties, advertisements and much more examine the meaning of a today\u2019s national state in contrast to something which should be very familiar to everybody called globalization. The works, then, tell stories about leaving and coming back into a place that is long gone; they represent the disillusionment with the present social and political situation in her homeland. In the artist\u2019s own words: \u201cA reflective space is created through the process of art making, with the hope to overcome a collective sense of powerlessness and fear due to the endless turmoil and political chaos happening in Malaysia, especially in the precedent years before the 13th General Election, from 2011 to 2013. By doing so, I explore the dynamic between the personal and the politics, and how such relations influence a person\u2019s worldview. Positioning as a Chinese Malaysian female artist who has so far voted twice in my life, I introduce the concept of domestication as a methodology to interact with the state machine. To experiment with the concept of domestication \u2013 to feminize, to soften the once exuberant, masculine and heroic objects \u2013 to make them immobile and impotent through the action of folding, sewing, cutting and reassemblage. To emphasize the role of common people in their participation in the negotiation and making of democracy. \u2026\u2026 I decided to go deep in the object of flag and its symbolism. Flags are flamboyant, mobile and identifiable. They are objects of fraternalism that reinforce the identification of a collective, group or state. [With Domesticated Politics,] I slowly came up with the idea of making some DIY flags for the anonymous voters to celebrate their active participation in the General Election, partly inspired by a group of images documenting myself working with the electoral flags from different political parties. In the photographic images, I was seen folding, ironing, and assembling the triangle flags on the floor. By following the proportion of the national flag of Malaysia, my DIY flags are made smaller in the form of pillowcases. At the front of the flags, the movement of the working hands serves as a major thread running through the sequence of nine images recomposed according to their visual rhythm. At the back of each flag, a fabric of a colorful pattern that is used to suggest the people who are wearing it \u2013 the anonymous voters like you and me, gives the front image \u2013 the flags tamer, the necessary solidarity.\u201d style significance: Minstrel Kuik is a Sino-Malaysian artist born in Pantai Remis, Perak, in 1976.

The series was originally commissioned for the Concept Context Contestation exhibition at the BACC in Bangkok in 2014, and represents the artist\u2019s first performance for the camera; he had previously only staged live performances. (The original idea was to invite people to participate in the rolling of the tyres, but budgets would not stretch that far.) The tyre rolling game \u2013 gwye hlain in Burmese \u2013 was popular among Burmese children 30 years ago. From 1962 to 1988, i.e. from Ne Win\u2019s seizing of political power to his passing, the country was closed off to most foreign influence and goods, so bicycle tyres were the only things most children could get their hands on; also popular in this regard were the spokes from wheels. Moe Satt used to play such games as a child, in the 1980s. Dressed in traditional costume that is frequently politicians and members of parliament, Moe Satt poses for pictures of himself playing gwye hlain at various sites around Yangon, chosen for both historical context and personal significance. As he puts it, his sartorial choice is ironic insofar as ordinary citizens like himself for the large part are denied political agency in Burmese system, while also calling into question the idea of tradition itself. historical significance: Burmese artist Moe Satt (b. 1983) lives and works in Yangon, having been trained in zoology at East Yangon University. In the early days of his career as an artist, he was involved with NICA \u2013 the brainchild of Jay Koh and Chu Chu Yuan, who were based Myanmar in the 2000s \u2013 as a graphic designer; it was at NICA that he was first exposed to contemporary and performance art, which was to inspire his later career. (His very first piece, staged during a performance festival at NICA in 2005, involved moving around with his body hidden in a t-shirt.) Moe Satt was also loosely connected with the Gangaw Village group during those early days: the GV group used to hold gatherings every Saturday, where Moe Satt would appear, and also participated in the group\u2019s annual shows. As he relates it, it was there that he became acquainted with other local contemporary artists such as Chaw Ei Thein and Htein Lin. In the mid-2000s, Moe Satt would stage guerrilla perform on the streets of Yangon \u2013 short performances lasting around 10 mins \u2013 and then flee the oncoming authorities. From the later part of the decade on, he began to travel outside of Myanmar, for both performances and short-term studies. In 2008, for instance, he undertook his first residency at Rimbun Dahan in Malaysia, which led to a performance with local artists Sharon Chin, Rahmat Haron, Poodien and Intan Rafieza, called Open Streets, which took place in front of the Maybank building in downtown Kuala Lumpur. That same year, he initiated the Beyond Pressure performance festival with Maung Day, along with Aung Ko and Phyu Mon, among others, with financial support from the Prince Claus Fund. Seven editions of Beyond Pressure have taken place since: in 2008, 2009 (Beyond Pressure 1.5), a second edition in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2014. Temporary hiatus. Since 2010, Moe Satt\u2019s work has explored the history of the 20th century in Myanmar. (From an interview conducted by the curator with the artist in Yangon, 23 September, 2017.)

As he puts it, his sartorial choice is ironic insofar as ordinary citizens like himself for the large part are denied political agency in Burmese system, while also calling into question the idea of tradition itself.  The four locations are: Inya Lake, which was the site of protests by university students in the popular uprising of 1988; the site was close to Yangon University. It is also a popular dating spot for young couples, and Moe satt used to frequent the lakeside with his then girlfriend (now wife). Kandawgyi Lake, with the gleaming tip of the Shwedagon Pagoda visible in the background, as well as the ornate floating Karaweik restaurant. The latter, an iconic Yangon landmark, was a much-frequented tourist spot, even during the Ne Win era; the general\u2019s daughter used to throw parties there, according to the artist. The artist also used to hang out there as a young student, while playing truant from school. He confesses that he used to be part of a teen gang, and would be embroiled in gang fights in the Kandawgyi neighbourhood, using iron chains and metal rings as weapons. The statue of Bogyoke Aung San. Aung San, of course, is considered the father of independence in Myanmar, and widely revered even today. The monument is located near Kandawgyi park (also known as Bogyoke Park). The Independence Monument is located in front of City Hall, and was the site of numerous riots, protests, mass gatherings and public speeches; a week before Aung San\u2019s assassination in 1947, for instance, he made one of his most famous public speeches there. During the colonial era, the area was known as Queen Elizabeth Park. It also served as a gathering spot for the Saffron revolution in 2007, and the artist remembers picnicking there with his family, growing up in downtown Yangon.   As Moe Satt observes, history is rolling, not unlike the childhood games he used to play with bicycle tyres. In Bicycle Tyre Rolling Event from Yangon, he makes a visual statement about the movement of history \u2013 whether in forward fashion or backward, in the manner of a rolling tyre, where the two are indistinguishable on their own, without the context of the surrounding space. He frequently utilizes the motif of childhood games in his work (e.g. in his use of brightly coloured balloons elsewhere), and, here, the chief conceptual juxtaposition is that between life, represented by the phenomenon of childhood games and performative gestures (in the presence of the artist\u2019s body) and the stasis, stillness and weight of the political monuments and historical sites he commemorates, the tension of personal memory and the everyday and the grand narratives of politics embodied in physical space and heft.  style significance: Burmese artist Moe Satt (b. 1983) lives and works in Yangon, having been trained in zoology at East Yangon University.

It also served as a gathering spot for the Saffron revolution in 2007, and the artist remembers picnicking there with his family, growing up in downtown Yangon.   As Moe Satt observes, history is rolling, not unlike the childhood games he used to play with bicycle tyres. In Bicycle Tyre Rolling Event from Yangon, he makes a visual statement about the movement of history \u2013 whether in forward fashion or backward, in the manner of a rolling tyre, where the two are indistinguishable on their own, without the context of the surrounding space. He frequently utilizes the motif of childhood games in his work (e.g. in his use of brightly coloured balloons elsewhere), and, here, the chief conceptual juxtaposition is that between life, represented by the phenomenon of childhood games and performative gestures (in the presence of the artist\u2019s body) and the stasis, stillness and weight of the political monuments and historical sites he commemorates, the tension of personal memory and the everyday and the grand narratives of politics embodied in physical space and heft.  exhibition utilisation: While shows of contemporary art from other Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam and the Philippines have been organized by SAM in recent years, Myanmar as yet remains very much under the radar screen. Any survey of the scene in Myanmar would do ill to omit a figure like Moe Satt, who ranks as one of the preeminent female artists of hi generation.",

            "description": "description: Mon Boulet is the third major performance work by Cambodian artist Svay Sareth. In May 2011, Sareth dragged a giant metal ball from his home in Siem Reap to the city of Phnom Penh, a 250 kilometer journey that took 6 days. The metal sphere was of a 2 metre wide diameter and weighed a hefty 80 kilograms. Svay spent most of his life in refugee camps and the experience of surviving and what it means to be a survivor of Cambodia's turbulent and violent history is the structuring force behind his artistic practice and psychological outlook. There are multiple layerings to Sareth's simple act of dragging the ball. In the most direct sense, it represents the immense personal baggage from the past that still lingers unresolved in Cambodian society. Like a \u201cball and chain\u201d, it is also a comment on the tendency of history to imprison the present. More locally, it refers to the forced labour practices under the Khmer Rouge, where men would be harnessed to carts and made to work the fields.  Svay Sareth is the co-founder of Phare Phonlue Selepak, an art school in Battambang. As a child, Sareth was a member of the small and historic group of children who studied art in the Site 2 refugee camps with V\u00e9ronique Decrop. Sareth has had solo shows in New York and Cambodia, and exhibited in numerous group shows in Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, France and Berlin. historical significance: Mon Boulet is the third major performance work by Cambodian artist Svay Sareth. In May 2011, Sareth made a 6-day, 250 kilometre trek dragging a giant metal ball from his home in Siem Reap to the city of Phnom Penh. The metal sphere was of a 2 metre wide diameter and weighed a hefty 80 kilograms. At night he slept on a sheet of blue tarpaulin, like that commonly used by refugees, and ate only food offered to him by strangers. For Sareth, this almost superhuman feat of endurance is much more than a passing performance; it is a necessary personal catharsis. Svay spent most of his life in refugee camps and the experience of surviving and what it means to be a survivor of Cambodia's turbulent and violent history is the structuring force behind his artistic practice and psychological outlook. In Mon Boulet, it is impossible for viewers to get a sense of the sheer physical effort expensed, particularly also because Sareth appears to manoeuvre his load with such ease. Known to enter into a trance-like state of heightened spirituality and concentration when he performs, this process masks the performance's brutal reality in the same way that no form of communication can ever wholly expose or relate the horrific actuality of living through war. There are multiple layerings to Sareth's simple act of dragging the ball. In the most direct sense, it represents the immense personal baggage from past that still lingers unresolved in Cambodian society. Like a \u201cball and chain\u201d, it is also a comment on the tendency of history to imprison the present. More locally, it refers to the forced labour practices under the Khmer Rouge, where men would be harnessed to carts and made to work the fields. Mon Boulet came to acquire further meaning along the way of Sareth's journey as curious and moved bystanders started to write questions on the ball. Many, if not most, of these questions will and can never be answered. The continuous rolling of the ball has effaced some of these markings, and Sareth's journey itself has a sense of pointlessness, but it is precisely from this that Mon Boulet acquires its dignity and grace. To endure, not only one's own weight but of history, and of others, is to live on.   Svay's artistic practice navigates both present and historical moments as he employs art to come to terms with his personal experiences and memories of war and being a refugee. In the artist's words, \u201cThe heart is marked forever by the atrocities of the war. The mind - the seat of the body's creative power - is a force of alchemy able to transform the difficulty, the fear, the suffering, the discouragement, into energy and creative freedom.

            "description": "description: Peripheral Ritual I, II, III consists of three paintings made individually but presented as a triptych. As in the other paintings on aeronautical fabric, paint is thinned and allowed to flow, diffuse and spread without direct contact of the brush. The result is a porous, translucent surface marked by a variety of stains and marks that come across as coincidental but are in fact carefully constructed through a process that resembles a piece of choreography. By applying various bodily gestures \u2014 shifting, tilting and turning \u2014 fragments are played against one another without complete resolution, allowing an open work to take shape. These paintings act like mirrors, reflecting and echoing each other but also deviating through repetition.  Tan\u2019s practice of painting explored his fixation with distance and closeness through which he enquiries into the relation between movement (in time and space) and painting. In this process, the artist discovered and began to apply paint on an aeronautical fabric. This a very thin, translucent but durable material does not absorb paint well and hence, allowed Tan to play with paint and their movement across the surface of the fabric. The process of painting becomes much more animated and results in surfaces that embody bodily movement and time, physics and materiality. Elements, such as frayed fabric, rubber, Arabic gum, etc. are introduced to interact with (or impede) the flow of paint, leaving marks that accentuate the materiality of colour.  This extends his interest in exploring how the physical ground of a painting is not only a space to contain gestures of mark making but also serves as a \u201ca screen for imaginings and haunting\u201d. Recalling his interest in the moving image, here, Tan directs paint across the surface through pouring and tilting. Maneuvering laws of physics and material properties, the artist\u2019s body establishes a durational relationship with the painting, now both surface and object while colour and gradient is produced through time and space.  historical significance: Guo-Liang Tan\u2019s work establishes the relevance of painting in contemporary art and invites critical reflections on painting as practice in the region while engaging in conversation with global discourses. Amidst a generation of artists emerging post-2000s who are exploring but also challenging the modes of artistic production, art itself and relevance to contemporary society, Tan\u2019s practice has a unique position as conceptually-based work that, through a persistent use of the long-established medium of painting, a wide range of discourse on contemporary art. There are no works of Guo-Liang Tan in the National Collection.  style significance: Guo-Liang Tan is one of the few artists in Singapore who engages the practice of painting as a conceptual device to explore the nature of images and their relationship to life. His painterly surfaces are material and can be seen as moving still images that experiment with shifts in notions of time, space, movement and physicality. Refusing (or rather, actively engaging) convenient categorisation of the representational, abstract, etc., his works are instead conversations with ideas of expression and abstraction with a keenness to the affective. It is worth noting that Tan emerged in the post-2000 period when painting and contemporary art is in a somewhat odd relationship, the latter giving emphasis to other forms such as performance, video, new media, ethnographic-driven, community-based, relational, socially engaged practices, and so on. Tan\u2019s practice puts the medium of painting in close dialogue with the histories and canons of art and contemporary modes of artistic production with intellectual rigour.   Tan belongs to a generation of artists whose creative output extends beyond his own studio practice. Alongside his own work, he also collaborates with other artists on curatorial and publication projects, including Aversions and Found & Lost (2009) for Osage Gallery, We Who Saw Signs (2011) for Institute of Contemporary Arts Singapore, LASALLE, Side Affects (2019) for Ota Fine Arts and State Of Motion 2020: Rushes Of Time for Asian Film Archive and Strange Forms of Life (2021) for STPI, Singapore.  exhibition utilisation: The work can be included in a wide range of exhibitions. Beyond those that explore painting and image-making, the proposed acquisition can be put in dialogue with works that engages art historical and conceptual contexts, that explore subjects of time, memory, body and performance, symbolism, abstraction, affect and expression, and so on.

            "description": "description: Wong Hoy Cheong is one of Malaysia\u2019s foremost contemporary artists, and is both deeply engaged with socio- political activism, in recent years, and with issues and concerns that reflect the historical and social trajectories of his country\u2019s post-war development. His career as an artist began as a schoolboy in 1970s Penang, at the Penang Free School, and took flight during his years as a college and graduate student in the U.S. It was upon his return to his native country in 1986 that, while teaching at the Malaysia Institute of Art (he was to influence generations of artists who passed through his classroom), his work turned from what has been dubbed \u201cthe historical-mythical aspects of Malay culture\u201d, as evidenced by paintings such as Kuda Kepang (1986) and Tasik Cini (1987), to more contemporary themes, seen in works like Detention Oct. 1987 (1989), which dealt with the controversial Operation Lalang of 1987, an event that was to characterise for many the heavy-handed authoritarianism of the Mahathir years. The latter belongs to a crucial lineage in Wong\u2019s practice, one that, according to Krishen Jit, revolves around \u201ca contemporary condition as experienced by the artist: social oppression.\u201d Socio-political repression and marginalization was, in fact, to prove the abiding concern of Wong\u2019s creative trajectory \u2013 along with an interest in the hybrid, multi-cultural histories of Malaysia \u2013 and the 1990s was to see the efflorescence of these themes in his work. An early instance was the multi-medial Sook Ching (1991), encompassing painting, performance and video; other seminal moments include the exhibition, \u201cOf Migrants and Rubber Trees\u201d in 1996, one that \u201cpresented a grand diorama of the immigrant experience against a backdrop of empire/nation-building from the colonial era to today\u201d (as described by Beverly Yong), and the installation-and-performance piece, Lalang (1994). The latter was a further response to the aforementioned  Operation Lalang, which witnessed the arrest of some 106 individuals \u2013 ranging from NGO activists, opposition politicians, intellectuals, students, artists, scientists and others \u2013 who were detained without trial under the Internal Security Act (ISA). It was the second largest ISA swoop in Malaysian history since the 13 May riots, and was popularly believed to be an offensive against then PM Mahathir\u2019s political opponents.   Lalang also anticipates the overtly political bent of Wong\u2019s output from the late \u201890s to early 2000s, itself inspired by the Reformasi movement of the period. The movement arose from very visible fallout that occurred in the wake of Anwar Ibrahim\u2019s deposition by then-PM Mahathir: an active citizenry mobilized to call for deep, structural reforms in the nation\u2019s notoriously corruption-laden political landscape. It was a seminal moment, and Wong found himself caught up in the fervour. Works like Tapestry of Justice (1998) and Vitrine of Contemporary Events (1999) was his response to the energy, dynamism and ideals of late \u201890s reformasi; the former, for one, was a collection of thumbprints of numerous individuals, stitched together into a hanging installation resembling a tapestry, to support the abolishment of the ISA, a petition assuming the guise of contemporary art. Wong also continued exploring ideas of history and cultural identity during this phase of his career, albeit, again, with an explicitly political dimension to his investigations. Text Tiles (2000), for one, a floor-bound installation comprised of tiles covered with the pulped remains of various publications of history and politics, interrogated the fashionable stance of so-called Asian \u201cvalues\u201d as espoused by many leaders of Asian nations. Into the new millennium, Wong\u2019s practice further evinced his concern with the phenomena of oppression, marginalization, historical essentialism and colonialism that had come to characterize his work. Re:Looking (2002) reverses and reimagines the colonial imperative by fabricating a Malaysian empire that had colonized Austria; Maid in Malaysia (2008) takes on the underclass of foreign domestic labour in the country; Doghole (2010) represents a continuation of Wong\u2019s interest in the Japanese Occupation of Malaya.   Tapestry of Justice was developed and exhibited alongside the Vitrine of Contemporary Events (also in SAM\u2019s collection). Photocopies of the thousands of thumbprints collected during the Reformasi movement are connected by leaves and petals of plants like hibiscus, roses and beech; thus far, the tapestry is made up of over 10,0000 thumbprints, stuck together using small pieces of acetate and glue and covered at intersections with different petals and leaves. The contribution of thumbprints constitutes symbolic actions for the repeal of the Internal Security Act (ISA) in Malaysia. The tapestry is to look delicate and beautiful - an ironic comment on how important and fragile basic civil rights are. As Wong relates it, he began the work after the sacking of Anwar, sometime in Sept or Oct 1998. He was interested in producing a piece involving mass participation: how criminals are thumbprinted, and a thumbprint becomes the most reliable form of identity (before DNA sequencing). For instance, when one signs a petition a signature can be forged but not a thumbprint, so thumbprinting becomes the ultimate form of commitment here. TOJ began life simultaneously as a petition \u2013 against the ISA \u2013 and a work of art, with Wong approaching strangers in public areas to solicit support. The petition and work began in Kuala Lumpur. Wong went around to bus-stops, pubs, NGO meetings, churches, Reformasi demonstrations etc to seek support and thumbprints, explaining what he was doing to total strangers, and whether they were for or against the ISA. October 1998 also marked the anniversary of Operasi Lalang, and hence the timing also served as a commemoration of sorts. There were 4 different stages of the project, and therefore 3 dates and 3 types of flowers and leaves are included in the scroll (hibiscus, beech, red rose). The first stage in happened in KL, the second in Denmark (Wong was showing the work in the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art) and UK (he was exhibiting at the Hayward, as part of the Cities on the Move exhibition), and then in KL again. The tapestry was assembled at the four abovementioned points. Wong continued adding to the original portions at those 4 stages, along with the appropriate plants. The tapestry in its present form was last added to in KL in 2004, so the work dates as 1998 to 2004.  The original idea was to keep petitioning, and once the ISA was repealed Wong intended to donate the work to the state, but unfortunately the ISA was repealed under Najib Razak\u2019s tenure, and Wong was reluctant to donate it under the Najib administration. (From an interview with Wong in Kuala Lumpur, on 22 May 2019. SAM conservator Nahid M. Pour and project manager Liza Ho were also present.)  TOJ has been shown in in the Hayward and Bluecoat galleries in the U.K., in the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Denmark, in KHIASMA in Finland, in Bluecoat gallery in UK, Eslite gallery in Taiwan and in the NVAG in Malaysia. The thumbprinting of audiences happened at the bigger venues \u2013 e.g. museums \u2013 where the work was shown.  historical significance: The time is ripe for SAM to mount a survey of contemporary Malaysian art. While shows of contemporary art from other Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam and the Philippines have been organized by our institution in recent years, Malaysia as yet remains very much under the radar screen \u2013 yet this is a country that, up to five decades ago, Singapore was a part of. Any survey of the scene in Malaysia would do ill to omit a figure like Wong, who ranks as one of the preeminent artists of his generation. style significance: The National Collection \u2013 or, at least, those parts of it that come under the purview of SAM \u2013 is at present rather lacking in contemporary Malaysian art. The country boasts few contemporary artists of international stature, with practices that are informed, complex, nuanced, cogent. The present work by Wong Hoy Cheong, one of the country\u2019s foremost contemporary artists, emerged from a particularly prolific point in his career, and should be represented in the Natl. Collection. exhibition utilisation: The time is ripe for SAM to mount a survey of contemporary Malaysian art.

He first learnt the craft of traditional carpentry and woodcarving from his father, Tengku Ibrahim Wook, himself a master craftsman. Tengku Sabri was later trained in sculpture and print-making. Kumpulan Lukisan-lukisan Gelap/ A Suite of Dark Drawings is a set of 12 drawings that chronicles, in a deeply personal, intimate, revelatory fashion, the experience of a debilitating stroke, and its aftermath, that the artist suffered in 2014. Each of the drawings is accompanied by a caption, in Tengku Sabri\u2019s own words, that provides a context for the visuals. The drawings are notable for the unflinching look at the emotional and \u2013 indeed \u2013 corporeal toil that illness takes. As Tengku Sabri notes:\u201cI was down with a stroke attack in late 2014. The attack paralyzed my left side of the body. And it means that I couldn\u2019t hold chisels and other tools to make sculptures. But I fought hard to continue making art. Fortunately, a young artist-friend agreed to help me making sculptures through sketches and instructions from me... and still, I insist on not to back down, and start drawing as I still can use my good right hand. That gave birth to an ink-drawing suite which I titled here as the \u2018Dark Drawings.\u2019 I here exhibited 12 drawings of the suite.It was like a visual journal, documenting the early phase of the after attack.\u201d  historical significance: Malay-Muslim artist, Tengku Sabri Tengku Ibrahim, was born in Jerteh, Terengganu, in 1961.

Serangan itu menyebabkan kelumpuhan pada badanku di sebelah kiri; dan ini bermakna aku tidak dapat menggunakan tangan kiriku, memegang pahat dan alatan lain untuk membuat arca.

Maka, lahirlah sebuah kumpulan lukisan dakwat atas kertas yang aku namakan \u2018Lukisan-Lukisan Gelap\u2019 ini. But I fought hard to continue making art. Fortunately, a young artist-friend agreed to help me making sculptures through sketches and instructions from me... and still, I insist on not to back down, and start drawing as I still can use my good right hand. That gave birth to an ink-drawing suite which I titled here as the \u2018Dark Drawings.\u2019  Disini, aku pamerkan di sebanyak 12 keping lukisan dari Kumpulan itu. Ia adalah seperti sebuah Jurnal Visual pada awal waktu selepas aku terkena serangan Angin Ahmar itu. Berikut adalah senarai pilihan lukisan lukisan itu bersama pernyataan ringkasnya. I here exhibited 12 drawings of the suite.It was like a visual journal, documenting the early phase of the after attack.\u201d   (Please refer to Annex A for a list of the twelve drawings and their accompanying captions.)  exhibition utilisation: The time is ripe for SAM to mount a survey of contemporary Malaysian art. While shows of contemporary art from other Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam and the Philippines have been organized by our institution in recent years, Malaysia as yet remains very much under the radar screen \u2013 yet this is a country that, up to five decades ago, Singapore was a part of. Any survey of the scene in Malaysia would do ill to omit a figure like Mokhtar, who represents one of the most important and critical contemporary voices. ",

However, their forms and presentation are quite different: 'Peripheral Ritual' is a triptych using aeronautical fabric to explore translucency while 'Tapestry of Justice' is a tapestry, more focused on texture and hanging form.

'Peripheral Ritual' explores abstract themes of movement, time, and materiality within the context of painting. In contrast, 'Tapestry of Justice' is deeply rooted in socio-political activism, focusing on specific historical events and communal participation.

Tan's work examines the painter's interaction with material and movement, while Tengku Sabri reflects on personal struggle and physical limitations due to his stroke. There is a shared underlying theme of bodily interaction with the medium, though the contexts differ. Tan focuses on the mechanics and possibilities of painting, whereas Sabri's work is more about personal documentation and reflection after a life-changing event.",

Wong Hoy Cheong's 'Tapestry of Justice' is a large-scale installation art piece that uses thumbprints, acetate, and plant materials to create a structurally complex and delicate hanging form. Its focus is on collective identity using a minimalist approach. Meanwhile, Tengku Sabri Tengku Ibrahim's 'A Suite of Dark Drawings' consists of 12 individual ink drawings, each rich in detail and depicting personal, emotive content. The dark, intense visual storytelling through detailed, figurative drawings contrasts with Wong's abstract, textured installation. Both employ intricate detail, but their mediums and presentation are very different, leading to a low visual connectivity score.",

Wong Hoy Cheong's work is rooted in socio-political activism, specifically targeting laws and issues of civil rights in Malaysia. It uses art as a form of protest against oppressive legislation. Conversely, Tengku Sabri's drawings detail a personal struggle with a stroke, offering personal introspection rather than collective activism. Despite this difference, both artists use their work to comment on oppression and struggle\u2014one through a broader social lens, the other through personal experience. This shared thematic concern results in a moderate narrative connectivity score.",
