The artist conceived this installation to serve simultaneously as a work of art and a petition. This was during Malaysia\u2019s late 1990s Reformasi movement, when the redress of social injustices and other political issues held sway. For the next six years, the artist collected the thumbprints shown here to repeal the nation\u2019s Internal Security Act, which allowed for detention without trial. The dual symbolism of thumbprints is ironic\u2014conventionally viewed as evidential of criminal activity, the thumbprint was also the most reliable form of personal identification before the advent of DNA sequencing. Fragile and hopeful, the tapestry emphasises the power of collective effort in effecting transformation.",

Across the panels, thinned paint is allowed to flow, diffuse and spread without direct brush contact. This method, applied to the slightly water-resistant aeronautical fabric surfaces, produces stains and marks that appear accidental. They are, however, meticulously composed through a process akin to choreography. The artist describes his approach as using his \u201cown body to respond to the painting as objects,\u201d employing gestures such as shifting, tilting and turning. This physicality of the paintings is also asserted by the wooden stretcher bars that are visible through the translucent fabric. The amorphous hues evoke the appearance of bruised skin and suggest the body\u2019s capacity to endure.",

Ethereal and idyllic, they evoke a utopian realm of rest and reward, like Elysium. On closer look, the fuzzy flowers are found to be meticulously handspun balls of hair, specifically the hair shorn of cancer patients, survivors and donors in the Hair for Hope charity programme. These are arranged on a lightbox that Imhathai Suwatthanasilp had repurposed from a bed frame. Starkly backlit, the strands offer a tender tribute to the resilience of the human spirit. Imhathai dedicates her craftsmanship towards a message of hope for a brighter future.",

The medication gestures to the artist\u2019s HIV-positive status, rendering this series deeply autobiographical. Striking dramatic poses, the figures mime the Greek myths of Ganymede, Atlas, Icarus and Apollo, after how they are typically portrayed in early history paintings: Ganymede, desired for his youthful beauty, was abducted by Zeus in the guise of an eagle, and became both immortal cupbearer and the object of Zeus\u2019s desire; Atlas, punished for siding with the losing side in the Titan-Olympian war, was burdened with the weight of heavens for eternity; Icarus plunged into the sea after soaring too close to the sun despite his father\u2019s advice; Apollo, god of the sun, whose charisma masked an egoistic, jealous and sometimes vengeful nature. The fates and symbolism of these four characters resonate with Kugan\u2019s sense of the tragedy and irony of his own predicament.",
